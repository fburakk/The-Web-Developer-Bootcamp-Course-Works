## Course Works

In the first 20 sections of this  course, i practiced with the technologies like HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap 3, jQuery. Afterthat i developed a full-stack web application named "Yelp Camp" in which authenticated users can share and edit some contents and also comment to them. I used NodeJS, to write server-side JavaScript with ExpressJS, Bootstrap 3 and MongoDB.

The application [Yelp Camp](https://guarded-cove-71149.herokuapp.com) is hosted on [Heroku Cloud Application Platform](https://www.heroku.com/).

The restful routes and mongoose methods that i use is expressed in [here](https://fburakk.github.io/The-Web-Developer-Bootcamp-Course-Works/) with the dogs example.
